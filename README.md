This repository is the official starter kit for building applications with the **Ramme UI** component library. It provides the ideal local environment for designers and developers to rapidly build, test, and validate high-fidelity, interactive prototypes.

The starter kit comes pre-configured with a modern frontend stack to ensure a smooth development experience, allowing you to focus on building your application instead of on project setup.

---

## Getting Started

To create a new project using this starter kit, run the following command in your terminal. This will scaffold a new application in a directory of your choice.

*(Replace `your-project-name` with the actual name you want for your folder).*

```bash
npm create @ramme-io/app@latest your-project-name
```

This single command will:

- Create a new project folder.

- Install all necessary dependencies, including React, Vite, and @ramme-io/ui.

- Set up the recommended folder structure and configuration files.

##Post-Installation Steps

After the installation is complete, follow these 3 steps to launch your app:

# 1. Navigate into your new project

```bash
cd your-project-name
```
# 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```
# 3. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Your new Ramme application will be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## The Ramme Ecosystem
The Ramme project is an integrated framework architected across three separate repositories:

* `@ramme-io/ui` A public, open-source component library distributed as an NPM package.

* `ramme-app-starter` (This Repository): A public, open-source starter-kit application that provides the ideal local environment for building with Ramme.

* `ramme-app-builder` A hosted SaaS application featuring our AI Prototyping Assistant, which guides users through the strategic A.D.A.P.T. Framework to build applications from a solid strategic foundation.
